IN CLASS PART
This is the first in class exercise yesterday. We need to write totally 4 programs, 
1. Sum of odd numbers between 1&100 using FOR loop
2. Sum of odd numbers between 1&100 using WHILE loop
3. sum of even numbers between-1&-200 using FOR loop
4. sum of even numbers between -1&-200 using WHILE loop"""
